# Collab-Exercise

This was done for a collaboration exercise where I was tasked with creating an "About Me" page for my partner, Deshawn Curtis, based on the information he provided to me. This was done to practice with our teamwork and design skills. This includes a HTML code, a CSS code, and stock images attached.
